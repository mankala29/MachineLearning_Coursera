# Machine Learning 
This project is a broad introduction to machine learning, data mining and statistical pattern recognition.

Topics include:

(i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks).
(ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning).
(iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI).

The exercises implemented as a part of the course are machine learning models which are worked out in MATLAB, which contain the following -

1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Multi-class Classification and Neural Networks
4. Neural Networks
5. Regularized Linear Regression and Bias vs. Variance
6. Support Vector Machines
7. K-means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis
8. Anomaly Detection and Recommender Systems
